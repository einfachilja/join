              <h2>What is Join?</h2>
              <p>
                <span class="join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project
                management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
                students as part of their web development bootcamp at the
                Developer Akademie.
              </p>

              <p>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly
                effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
                maximize efficiency (or flow).
                <span class="join">Join</span> leverages the principles of
                kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an
                intuitive, visual interface.
              </p>

              <p>

            <div class="how-to-use-it-section">
              <p>
                Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
                <span class="join">Join</span>:
              </p>

              <div class="step-by-step-guide-section">

                  <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                  <p>
                    When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll
                    find a default board. This board represents your project and
                    contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                    feedback” and "Done".
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>

              <div class="step-by-step-guide-section">

                  <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                  <p>
                    In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
                    collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                    click on "New contact", and fill in the required
                    information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                    tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>

                <div>
                  <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                  <p>
                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding
                    cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+"
                    button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill
                    in the task details in the card, like task name,
                    description, due date, assignees, etc.
                  </p>
                </div>

                  <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                  <p>
                    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                    that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                    list to another.
                  </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                    <p>
                      Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the
                      "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently
                      remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when
                      deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
